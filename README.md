To download this packages using pip installer:

```javascript
pip install numpy
pip install tensorflow
pip install tensorflow-gpu
pip install sklearn
pip install scipy
pip install flask
pip install keras
```



open cmd to downloaded directory and run followig command

Future Imporvements:

Give a good look and feel to html.

Refresh after one styling is not allowed right now.(Due to memory shortage for regular computers)
